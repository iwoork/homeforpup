# Dogs List Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
The mobile-app was not showing your list of dogs. Instead, it was displaying mock/dummy data.

## Root Cause
The `DogsScreen.tsx` component had a TODO comment on line 25 and was using hardcoded mock data with a `setTimeout()` instead of calling the actual API to fetch real dogs.

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Backend (API)
**File:** `/apps/homeforpup-api/src/functions/dogs/list/index.ts`

- Added support for `ownerId` query parameter
- Dogs can now be filtered by owner ID on the server
- Deployed to AWS (deployment completed successfully)

### âœ… Frontend (Mobile App)
**Files Updated:**
1. `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/DogsScreen.tsx` - Main dogs list screen
2. `/apps/mobile-app/src/services/apiService.ts` - API service
3. `/apps/mobile-app/src/hooks/useApi.ts` - API hooks
4. `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Dashboard stats

**Changes:**
- âœ… Removed mock data
- âœ… Implemented real API calls using `apiService.getDogs()`
- âœ… Added `ownerId` parameter to filter dogs by current user
- âœ… Integrated with authentication context to get current user ID
- âœ… Added proper error handling with error banner
- âœ… Added retry functionality on errors
- âœ… Improved loading states and empty states
- âœ… Dashboard now shows user-specific stats

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Mobile App

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app
npm start
```

Then:
- Press `i` for iOS simulator
- Press `a` for Android emulator

### 2. Test the Dogs Screen

1. **Login** to the app with your breeder account
2. **Navigate** to the "Dogs" tab
3. **Observe:**
   - Loading state appears initially
   - Your actual dogs from the database are displayed
   - If you have no dogs, you see an empty state with "Add Dog" button
4. **Pull down** to refresh the list
5. **Check console logs** for API response details

### 3. Expected Behavior

**If you have dogs:**
- Shows your dogs with real data from the database
- Each dog shows: name, breed, gender, age, color, weight, status
- Stats are accurate

**If you have no dogs:**
- Shows empty state: "No Dogs Yet"
- Shows message: "Add your first dog to start building your kennel's breeding program"
- Shows "Add Dog" button

**If there's an error:**
- Shows red error banner at the top
- Shows error message
- Shows "Retry" button to try again

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App shows loading state while fetching dogs
- [ ] App displays real dogs (not mock data)
- [ ] Dogs are filtered to show only your dogs (not other breeders' dogs)
- [ ] Empty state appears if you have no dogs
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works correctly
- [ ] Error banner shows if API fails
- [ ] Retry button works after error
- [ ] Dashboard shows correct dog count for your user

## API Endpoint

The dogs endpoint now accepts the `ownerId` parameter:

```
GET https://822fu3f7bk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/development/dogs?ownerId=YOUR_USER_ID&limit=100
```

Or using the custom domain (if configured):

```
GET https://api.homeforpup.com/development/dogs?ownerId=YOUR_USER_ID&limit=100
```

## Console Logs to Check

When you open the Dogs screen, you should see logs like:

```
Fetching dogs for user: [your-user-id]
Dogs API response: { success: true, count: X, error: null }
User dogs fetched: { count: X, userId: [your-user-id] }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing no dogs

**Possible causes:**
1. You're not logged in
2. You actually have no dogs in the database
3. Your user ID doesn't match any dogs in the database

**Check:**
- Look at the console logs for the user ID
- Verify you're logged in (check if `user?.id` is defined)
- Check the API response in the logs

### Issue: Seeing an error banner

**Check the error message:**
- If it says "Network error" - check your internet connection
- If it says "Unauthorized" - try logging out and back in
- If it says "Failed to fetch dogs" - check API CloudWatch logs

**Try:**
- Press the "Retry" button in the error banner
- Pull down to refresh
- Restart the app

### Issue: App crashes or shows blank screen

**Check:**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check the React Native debugger for errors
- Check if the API is accessible

## What's Different Now

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// DogsScreen.tsx - Line 26
setTimeout(() => {
  setDogs([/* hardcoded mock dogs */]);
  setLoading(false);
}, 1000);
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
// DogsScreen.tsx - Line 28
const response = await apiService.getDogs({ 
  ownerId: user.id,
  limit: 100,
  page: 1 
});
setDogs(response.data.dogs);
```

## Files Changed

### Backend:
- âœ… `apps/homeforpup-api/src/functions/dogs/list/index.ts` (deployed)

### Frontend:
- âœ… `apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/DogsScreen.tsx`
- âœ… `apps/mobile-app/src/services/apiService.ts`
- âœ… `apps/mobile-app/src/hooks/useApi.ts`
- âœ… `apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app** to verify dogs are showing correctly
2. **Add dogs** if you don't have any (use the "Add Dog" button)
3. **Report any issues** you encounter

## Need Help?

If you're still not seeing your dogs:

1. Check the console logs in the React Native debugger
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify you're logged in
4. Check that you have dogs in the database with your user ID as the ownerId
