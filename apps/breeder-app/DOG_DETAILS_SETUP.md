# Dog Details Feature Setup

## Environment Variables Required

To use the dog details feature with photo uploads, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# AWS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=your-custom-domain.com

# AWS Credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# DynamoDB Table Names
DOGS_TABLE_NAME=homeforpup-dogs
KENNELS_TABLE_NAME=homeforpup-kennels

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key-here
```

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

To use a custom domain like `img.homeforpup.com` for your S3 bucket:

1. **Set up CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Create CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket
   - Configure alternate domain name: `img.homeforpup.com`
   - Set up SSL certificate for your domain

2. **Configure DNS**:
   - Create CNAME record: `img` â†’ `your-cloudfront-domain.cloudfront.net`

3. **Update Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=img.homeforpup.com
   ```

## API Endpoints

- `POST/GET /api/dogs/[id]/vet-visits` - Veterinary visit management
- `POST/GET /api/dogs/[id]/training` - Training record management  
- `POST/GET /api/dogs/[id]/photos` - Photo gallery management
- `POST /api/upload` - Server-side file upload to S3 (avoids CORS issues)

## Troubleshooting

### S3 Upload Errors
If you see "Empty value provided for input HTTP label: Bucket" error:
1. Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET` is set in your `.env.local`
2. Verify your AWS credentials are correct
3. Ensure the S3 bucket exists and you have write permissions

### CORS Errors
The app now uses server-side uploads to avoid CORS issues. If you still see CORS errors:
1. The upload API (`/api/upload`) handles file uploads server-side
2. No CORS configuration needed on the S3 bucket for this approach
3. Make sure the upload API endpoint is working correctly

### Form Warnings
The form warnings about single child elements are resolved by using a custom wrapper instead of Form.Item for the PhotoUpload component.

### React 19 Compatibility
The app uses Antd's App component to provide context for static functions like message notifications. All message API calls now use the `useApp` hook instead of the static `message` import to ensure proper context access.
