# Profile Edit Screen with Cognito Sync Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive profile editing system for the breeder app that saves all user information to both the database (DynamoDB) and AWS Cognito user attributes.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Cognito Service (`src/lib/cognito.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles updating user attributes in AWS Cognito
- **Features**:
  - Server-side and client-side Cognito attribute updates
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Type-safe attribute mapping
  - Support for all standard Cognito attributes (name, phone, address, etc.)

### 2. Profile API Endpoint (`src/app/api/profile/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized profile management API
- **Features**:
  - GET: Fetch current user profile from database
  - PUT: Update profile in database and sync to Cognito
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Support for all profile fields (personal info, preferences, breeder info, social links)
  - Dual sync to DynamoDB and Cognito

### 3. Profile Edit Page (`src/app/profile/edit/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: User-friendly profile editing interface
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive form with all profile fields
  - Photo upload with S3 integration
  - Real-time form validation
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Organized sections: Personal Info, Breeder Info, Social Media, Preferences

### 4. Dashboard Integration (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Easy access to profile editing
- **Features**:
  - Added "Edit Profile" button in Quick Actions
  - Added Personal Profile section in Profile Completion area
  - Prominent placement for easy access

### 5. Environment Configuration (`env.example`)
- **Purpose**: Added required environment variable
- **Features**:
  - Added `USERS_TABLE_NAME=homeforpup-users` for DynamoDB table reference

## Key Features Implemented

### Profile Fields Supported
1. **Personal Information**:
   - Full name, first name, last name
   - Display name (public)
   - Phone number
   - Location
   - Bio/description
   - Profile photo

2. **Breeder-Specific Information**:
   - Kennel name
   - License number
   - Years of experience
   - Website

3. **Social Media Links**:
   - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
   - Personal website

4. **Preferences**:
   - Notification settings (email, SMS, push)
   - Privacy settings (show email, phone, location)

### Cognito Attribute Mapping
The system automatically maps form fields to appropriate Cognito attributes:
- `name` → `name`
- `firstName` → `given_name`
- `lastName` → `family_name`
- `phone` → `phone_number`
- `location` → `address`
- `bio` → `profile`
- `profileImage` → `picture`

### Dual Storage Strategy
1. **Primary Storage**: DynamoDB (users table)
   - Stores all profile data including complex nested objects
   - Handles relationships and extended data
   - Primary source of truth for the application

2. **Secondary Sync**: AWS Cognito
   - Syncs key user attributes for authentication context
   - Ensures consistency across authentication flows
   - Graceful fallback if Cognito sync fails

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User must be authenticated via NextAuth with Cognito
2. Profile API validates session and user ID
3. Updates are scoped to authenticated user only
4. Cognito sync uses server-side credentials

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if Cognito sync fails
- User-friendly error messages

### Security
- Session-based authentication required
- User can only update their own profile
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential handling for AWS services

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Ensure environment variables are set (see `env.example`)
2. Users table must exist in DynamoDB
3. AWS credentials must have Cognito and DynamoDB permissions
4. NextAuth must be configured with Cognito provider

### For Users
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Click "Edit Profile" in Quick Actions or Profile Completion section
3. Update desired fields
4. Upload new profile photo if needed
5. Configure notification and privacy preferences
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. System automatically syncs to both database and Cognito

## Benefits
- **Data Consistency**: Dual storage ensures data is available in both systems
- **User Experience**: Single form updates everything
- **Authentication Integration**: Cognito attributes stay in sync
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all profile aspects (personal, business, preferences)
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Error Resilient**: Continues working even if one system fails

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time validation feedback
- Profile completion progress indicator
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Advanced photo editing capabilities
- Integration with external identity providers
