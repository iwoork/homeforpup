## 🔒 Authentication

### Getting a JWT Token

**Option 1: Via Cognito CLI**
```bash
aws cognito-idp initiate-auth \
  --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH \
  --client-id 3d6m93u51ggssrc7t49cjnnk53 \
  --auth-parameters USERNAME=user@example.com,PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

**Option 2: Via Frontend (recommended)**
Your frontend apps already handle authentication - just pass the JWT token from the session.

### Using the Token

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  "https://822fu3f7bk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/development/dogs"
