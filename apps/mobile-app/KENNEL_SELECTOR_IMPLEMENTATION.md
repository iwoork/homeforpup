# Kennel Selector Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added kennel selection functionality to the Add Dog and Edit Dog forms to ensure all dogs and puppies are associated with a kennel.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Service Updates (`src/services/apiService.ts`)

- Added `ownerId` parameter to `getKennels()` method to filter kennels by owner
- This allows forms to fetch only kennels owned by the current user

### 2. Create Dog Screen (`src/screens/forms/CreateDogScreen.tsx`)

#### Features Added:

- **Kennel Selector UI**: Added a kennel picker input field after the breed selector
- **Automatic Selection**: Automatically selects the first kennel if only one exists
- **Disabled State**: When only one kennel exists, the selector is disabled (grayed out) with a lock icon
- **Validation**: Added required validation for kennelId field
- **Modal Picker**: Added a modal to select from multiple kennels with kennel name and location display
- **Warning State**: Shows a warning message if no kennels exist, prompting user to create one first

#### UI Elements:

- Business icon for kennel selector
- Lock icon when only one kennel (disabled state)
- Chevron down icon when multiple kennels (clickable state)
- Helper text explaining the disabled state
- Visual selection indicator (checkmark and highlighting) in the modal

### 3. Edit Dog Screen (`src/screens/forms/EditDogScreen.tsx`)

#### Features Added:

- All the same features as Create Dog Screen
- Pre-selects the dog's current kennel
- Allows changing the kennel assignment (if multiple kennels exist)
- Helper text: "Only one kennel available. This dog will remain in this kennel."

#### Additional Improvements:

- Fixed error handling to properly delete error keys instead of setting empty strings
- Added `!!` boolean coercion for error checks to satisfy TypeScript
- Improved navigation after save (uses `goBack()` instead of complex navigation)

### 4. Styling

Added consistent styles for both forms:

- `warningContainer` - Yellow warning box for no kennels state
- `warningText` - Text styling for warnings
- `helperText` - Italic helper text for single kennel state
- `pickerButtonDisabled` - Grayed out appearance for disabled selector
- `disabledText` - Muted text color for disabled state
- `kennelItem` - List item styling in modal
- `kennelItemSelected` - Highlighted style for selected kennel
- `kennelItemIcon`, `kennelItemContent`, `kennelItemText`, `kennelItemTextSelected`, `kennelItemLocation` - Supporting styles for kennel display

## User Experience

### Single Kennel Scenario:

1. User sees kennel selector with their kennel name
2. Field is disabled (grayed out) with lock icon
3. Helper text explains: "Only one kennel available. All dogs will be added to this kennel."
4. Kennel is automatically assigned on form submission

### Multiple Kennels Scenario:

1. User sees kennel selector with current selection (or placeholder)
2. Field is clickable with chevron down icon
3. Tapping opens a modal showing all their kennels
4. Each kennel shows name and location (if available)
5. Selected kennel is highlighted with checkmark
6. User can select any kennel
7. Selection is validated before form submission

### No Kennels Scenario:

1. User sees a warning message
2. Text explains: "You need to create a kennel first before adding dogs."
3. Form cannot be submitted without a kennel

## Technical Details

### Validation

- Kennel selection is now required (marked with \*)
- Form validation checks `formData.kennelId` exists
- Error message: "Kennel is required"

### Data Flow

1. `useKennels({ ownerId: user?.userId })` fetches user's kennels
2. First kennel auto-selected if available
3. `formData.kennelId` stores selected kennel ID
4. Kennel ID included in dog creation/update payload

### Type Safety

- Added proper TypeScript types for error handling
- Used `!!` boolean coercion to prevent empty string type errors
- Proper cleanup of error state by deleting keys instead of setting empty strings

## Testing Considerations

1. Test with 0 kennels - should show warning
2. Test with 1 kennel - should be disabled and auto-selected
3. Test with multiple kennels - should allow selection
4. Test form validation - should require kennel
5. Test kennel display in modal - should show name and location
6. Test navigation after save - should return to previous screen
