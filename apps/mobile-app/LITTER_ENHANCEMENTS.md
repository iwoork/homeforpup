# Litter Form Enhancements

## Summary
Enhanced the litter creation and editing forms with improved selectors for breeds and parent dogs (sire/dam).

## Changes Made

### 1. Breed Selector Enhancement

**Before**: Free-text input field for breed name
**After**: Modal picker with searchable breed list from API

#### Features:
- **API Integration**: Fetches breeds from `/breeds` endpoint (limit: 200)
- **Visual Display**: Shows breed images from `https://homeforpup.com/breeds/{BreedName}.jpg`
  - Example: `https://homeforpup.com/breeds/Akita.jpg` for Akita breed
  - Falls back to breed's `image` field if available
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filter as user types
- **Modal Interface**: Slide-up modal with clean UI
- **Image Display**: 50x50 rounded images next to breed names
- **Loading State**: Shows "Loading breeds..." while fetching
- **Empty States**: 
  - No matches: "No breeds found matching '{query}'"
  - Clear search button when typing

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents typos and inconsistencies
- ✅ Visual breed recognition
- ✅ Easy to search and select
- ✅ Professional user experience

### 2. Parent Dog Selectors (Sire & Dam)

**New Feature**: Added required selectors for parent dogs

#### Sire (Father) Selector
- **Label**: "Sire (Father) *"
- **Icon**: Male icon in blue (#3b82f6)
- **Filter**: Shows only male parent dogs
- **Placeholder**: "Select sire (male parent)"

#### Dam (Mother) Selector
- **Label**: "Dam (Mother) *"
- **Icon**: Female icon in pink (#ec4899)
- **Filter**: Shows only female parent dogs
- **Placeholder**: "Select dam (female parent)"

#### Features:
- **API Integration**: Fetches from `/dogs` endpoint with `type: 'parent'` filter
- **Gender Filtering**: 
  - Sire picker: `dog.gender === 'male'`
  - Dam picker: `dog.gender === 'female'`
- **Visual Display**:
  - Shows dog photo if available
  - Placeholder with gender icon if no photo
  - Displays dog name and breed
- **Search Functionality**: Filter by dog name
- **Validation**: Both sire and dam are required fields
- **Empty States**:
  - With search: "No male/female dogs found matching '{query}'"
  - Without search: "No male/female parent dogs available. Add parent dogs first."

**Data Stored:**
```typescript
{
  sireId: string;  // ID of male parent dog
  damId: string;   // ID of female parent dog
}
```

```

### Litter Data Structure
```typescript
interface Litter {
  id: string;

  damId: "dog-456",               // FK to dogs table
  breedingDate: "2024-01-15",
  expectedDate: "2024-03-18",     // ~63 days from breeding
  // ... other fields
}

// Validation needed:
// 1. Verify sireId exists and gender === 'male'
// 2. Verify damId exists and gender === 'female'
// 3. Verify both dogs are type === 'parent'
