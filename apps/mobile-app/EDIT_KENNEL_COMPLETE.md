## Files Modified

  - Complete form implementation
  - Comprehensive validation
  - Modern UI with theme integration

  - Now properly opens edit screen when edit button clicked

- `/apps/mobile-app/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
  - Added `EditKennelScreen` import
  - Registered `EditKennel` screen in navigation stack
  - Configured with `headerShown: false` (custom header in screen)

## Technical Details

### State Management

- Uses React hooks (`useState`) for form state
- Separate state for active section, form data, loading, and errors
- Field-level error clearing on user input

### Styling

- Fully responsive layout
- Consistent with app theme
- Uses LinearGradient for header
- Proper spacing and typography
- Shadow effects for depth
- Switch components for boolean values

### Data Structure

- Matches `Kennel` type from `@homeforpup/shared-types`
- Properly structures nested objects (address, facilities, capacity, socialMedia)
- Handles optional fields correctly
- Preserves existing data that isn't editable (owners, managers, status, timestamps)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to Manage Kennels screen
- [ ] Click edit button on a kennel
- [ ] Verify all sections load with existing data
- [ ] Try submitting with empty required fields (should show errors)
- [ ] Test email validation with invalid format
- [ ] Test phone validation with short number
- [ ] Test URL validation without protocol
- [ ] Toggle facility switches
- [ ] Update capacity numbers
- [ ] Save successfully and verify navigation back
- [ ] Verify updated data persists in kennel list

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Photo upload for kennel images
- Map integration for address selection
- Specialty breeds multi-select
- Certifications and awards management
- Operating hours configuration
- Payment methods accepted

## Notes

- Form uses controlled components for all inputs
- Validation runs on save, not on blur (better UX for mobile)
- Empty optional fields are sent as `undefined` to API
- Current dogs/litters counts are preserved from existing kennel
- Header is custom (not using navigation header) for better design control
