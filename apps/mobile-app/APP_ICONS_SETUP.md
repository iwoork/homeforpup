```

**Icon Densities:**

- `mipmap-mdpi/` - Medium density (~160dpi)

Each density folder contains:

- `ic_launcher.png` - Standard launcher icon

## Store Assets

Additional store-ready assets are available in:

```
src/assets/
```

- `appstore.png` - App Store icon (1024x1024) for iOS submissions
- `playstore.png` - Play Store icon (512x512) for Android submissions
- `logo.png` - App logo for in-app use
- `placeholder.png` - Placeholder image

## Source Files

The original icon assets were sourced from:

- iOS: `/Users/Efren/Desktop/AppIcons/Assets.xcassets/`
- Android: `/Users/Efren/Desktop/AppIcons/android/`

The temporary `src/assets/ios-assets/` folder has been removed after successfully moving all icons to their proper locations.

## Next Steps

To see the new icons in your app:

### iOS

1. Clean the build folder: `cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..`
2. Rebuild the app: `npm run ios`

### Android

1. Clean the build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
2. Rebuild the app: `npm run android`

## Notes

- All icons follow the latest platform guidelines for iOS and Android
- The round launcher icon (Android) is currently identical to the standard launcher icon
- Icons are optimized for all device densities and screen sizes
- No code changes are required - the icons are automatically used by the platform
