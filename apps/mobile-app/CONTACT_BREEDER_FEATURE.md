└────────────────────┘
```

- **User-based permissions**:
  - Breeders (owners): See Edit/Delete buttons
  - Dog Parents: See "Contact Breeder" button
  
- **Contact Breeder functionality**:
  - Navigates to Messages screen
  - Pre-fills: receiverId, puppyId, puppyName, puppyBreed
  - Full-width button for better UX

---

## Message Navigation Flow

### Data Passed to Messages Screen:
```typescript
navigation.navigate('Messages', {
  receiverId: string,    // Breeder's user ID
  puppyId: string,       // Puppy/Dog ID
  puppyName: string,     // Puppy name (for context)
  puppyBreed?: string,   // Breed name (optional, from detail screen)
});
```

### Where Messages Screen Can Use This:
1. **Pre-fill subject**: "Interested in [puppyName]"
2. **Pre-fill message**: "Hi, I'm interested in your [puppyBreed] puppy, [puppyName]..."
3. **Show puppy card**: Display puppy info in the message thread
4. **Link back**: Quick link to return to puppy detail

## Console Logs for Debugging

### When Viewing Puppies:
```
Rendering puppy card: { id: "dog-123", name: "Max", breed: "Golden Retriever", hasId: true }
```

### When Clicking Contact:
```
Contact breeder for puppy: dog-123 user-456
Navigating to Messages with params: { receiverId: "user-456", puppyId: "dog-123", puppyName: "Max" }
```

### When Dog Detail Loads:
```
DogDetailScreen - received params: { hasDog: false, dogId: "dog-123" }
Fetching dog by ID: dog-123
API Response: { success: true, data: { dog: {...} } }
Dog fetched successfully: { id: "dog-123", name: "Max", ... }
```

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Current Implementation:
✅ Button UI implemented
✅ Navigation to Messages works
✅ Puppy context passed
✅ User permissions enforced

### Still Needed:

1. **Messages Screen Enhancement**:
   - [ ] Accept and use the passed params (receiverId, puppyId, etc.)
   - [ ] Pre-fill subject line
   - [ ] Pre-fill message template
   - [ ] Show puppy card in conversation
   - [ ] Link back to puppy detail

2. **Breeder ID Population**:
   - [ ] API should populate `ownerId` for all puppies
   - [ ] Alternatively, add `breederId` field
   - [ ] Currently uses placeholder in some screens (needs fixing)

3. **Message Templates**:
   - [ ] Add pre-written inquiry templates
   - [ ] Suggest questions for dog-parents
   - [ ] Auto-include puppy details in message

4. **Notification System**:
   - [ ] Notify breeder of new inquiry
   - [ ] Show puppy name in notification
   - [ ] Link to specific conversation

## Button Text Comparison

### Before:
- "Contact for price" (static text, not clickable)
- "Message" (generic, unclear context)

### After:
- "Contact Breeder" (clear action button)
- Consistent across all screens
- Icon included for better UX
- Actually functional (navigates to Messages)

---

## API Requirements

### Dogs API Should Include:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  ownerId: string;        // REQUIRED for contact feature
  name: string;
  breed: string;
  price?: number;         // Optional
  location?: string;      // Optional but recommended
  breederName?: string;   // Optional but recommended
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Recommendation:
The API should join with the Users table to populate:
- `breederName` from `users.name` or `users.displayName`
- `location` from `users.location`

This improves UX by showing breeder info without additional API calls.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 - Messages Screen (Immediate):
1. Update MessagesScreen to accept route params
2. Pre-fill receiver when params present
3. Add puppy info card to new conversation
4. Pre-fill subject: "Inquiry about [puppyName]"

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Messaging:
1. Add message templates for common inquiries
2. Show puppy thumbnail in message thread
3. Track which puppies get most inquiries
4. Add quick reply suggestions

### Phase 3 - Notifications:
1. Push notification when message received
2. Email notification for breeder
3. Badge count on Messages tab
4. Mark conversations by puppy

---

## Code Locations

### Contact Breeder Buttons:
- Search: Line 151-166 in `SearchPuppiesScreen.tsx`
- Matched: Line 107-121 in `MatchedPuppiesScreen.tsx`
- Favorites: Line 108-121 in `FavoritePuppiesScreen.tsx`
- Detail: Line 314-329 in `DogDetailScreen.tsx`

### Navigation Helper:
All buttons use similar pattern:
```typescript
(navigation as any).navigate('Messages', {
  receiverId: dog.ownerId,
  puppyId: dog.id,
  puppyName: dog.name,
  puppyBreed: dog.breed, // optional
});
```

---

## Accessibility

### Button Properties:
- ✅ Clear text labels
- ✅ Icon + text for better understanding
- ✅ Sufficient touch target size (44+ points)
- ✅ High contrast (white on primary color)
- ✅ Screen reader friendly

---

## Performance

### Optimizations:
- Event.stopPropagation() on contact button (prevents card click)
- Console logs for debugging (can be removed in production)
- Minimal re-renders (button state is stateless)
- No unnecessary API calls

---

## Conclusion

The "Contact Breeder" feature is now fully integrated across all dog-parent screens. Dog Parents can easily reach out to breeders about puppies from:
- Search results
- Matched puppies
- Favorite puppies
- Puppy detail pages

The implementation is consistent, user-friendly, and ready for the Messages screen to utilize the passed context for an enhanced messaging experience.

**Next critical step**: Update MessagesScreen to handle the pre-filled context and create a better first-message experience for dog-parents and breeders.
