## Technical Notes

- Uses the existing `VeterinaryVisit` type from `@homeforpup/shared-types`
- Integrates with existing API service architecture
- Follows app theming and design patterns
- Supports both parent dogs and puppies
- Backend API endpoints will need to be implemented to fully support this feature

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/forms/RecordVetVisitScreen.tsx` - New file
2. `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Added quick action
3. `/apps/mobile-app/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Added route
4. `/apps/mobile-app/src/services/apiService.ts` - Added API methods

## Backend Requirements

To fully enable this feature, the backend API needs to implement:

- `POST /vet-visits` - Create vet visit
- `GET /vet-visits` - List vet visits with filtering
- `GET /vet-visits/:id` - Get single vet visit
- `PUT /vet-visits/:id` - Update vet visit
- `DELETE /vet-visits/:id` - Delete vet visit

The backend should store vet visit records in DynamoDB with:

- Primary key: visit ID
- GSI on dogId for querying all visits for a specific dog
- Support for pagination and filtering
