# Fix for Vector Icons Not Showing

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Added UIAppFonts array to `ios/BreederIosApp/Info.plist` with all vector icon fonts
2. ✅ Created `react-native.config.js` (without assets to avoid duplicate copies)
3. ✅ Installed RNVectorIcons pod (version 10.3.0) which handles font copying
4. ✅ Cleaned the Xcode build and derived data
5. ✅ Fixed "Multiple commands produce" error by removing duplicate font asset linking

## The Issue & Solution

The initial error was "Multiple commands produce" for each font file because:

- The RNVectorIcons pod was copying fonts via CocoaPods (correct)
- The react-native-asset tool ALSO added font copy commands (duplicate)

**Solution**: Let the RNVectorIcons pod handle everything. The `react-native.config.js` should NOT include font assets.

## Steps to Get Icons Working

### Option 1: Rebuild in Xcode (Recommended)

1. Open the iOS project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   open BreederIosApp.xcworkspace
   ```

2. In Xcode:
   - Select `Product` → `Clean Build Folder` (⇧⌘K)
   - Select your target device or simulator
   - Click `Product` → `Build` (⌘B)
   - Once built, click `Product` → `Run` (⌘R)

### Option 2: Rebuild via Command Line

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app

# Clean everything
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ios/Pods/RNVectorIcons

# Reinstall pods
cd ios
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
pod install

# Go back and rebuild
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Option 3: Reset Metro and Rebuild

```bash
# Kill Metro if running
pkill -f "react-native"

# Clear Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# In another terminal:
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Verification

Once the app rebuilds and runs, you should see:

- ✅ Proper Ionicons in the bottom tab navigation (home, paw, chatbubbles, person icons)
- ✅ Icons in the Dashboard stat cards
- ✅ Icons in the Profile screen menu items
- ✅ Icons throughout the app instead of empty boxes

## Troubleshooting

If icons still don't show:

1. **Check the fonts are linked**: The fonts should be auto-linked via CocoaPods. Verify in Xcode that the `RNVectorIcons` pod is installed.

2. **Verify Info.plist**: Check that `ios/BreederIosApp/Info.plist` contains the `UIAppFonts` array with all font names.

3. **Complete Rebuild**: Sometimes you need to do a full clean:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   rm -rf build
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
   pod deintegrate
   pod install
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

## What Changed

### Files Modified:

- `ios/BreederIosApp/Info.plist` - Added UIAppFonts array
- `react-native.config.js` - Created to configure assets
- All screen files - Updated to use Ionicons instead of emoji

The vector icons should work after a complete rebuild!
