# Verified Badge Premium Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the verified dog parent and verified breeder badges as a premium feature. Users now need an active premium subscription to see verification badges on other users' profiles.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Type Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `/packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`
- `/src/types/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added premium subscription fields to the `User` interface:
  - `isPremium?: boolean` - Whether user has premium subscription
  - `subscriptionPlan?: 'basic' | 'premium' | 'pro'` - Subscription tier
  - `subscriptionStatus?: 'active' | 'cancelled' | 'expired' | 'trial'` - Subscription status
  - `subscriptionStartDate?: string` - When subscription started
  - `subscriptionEndDate?: string` - When subscription ends/renews

### 2. Premium Access Utility

**New Files Created:**
- `/packages/shared-hooks/src/usePremium.ts`
- `/packages/shared-hooks/src/index.ts`

**Exports:**
- `usePremium(user)` - Hook to check premium status with detailed information
- `canSeeVerifiedBadges(user)` - Utility function to check if user can see verified badges

**Logic:**
- Returns `true` if user has `isPremium: true` AND `subscriptionStatus: 'active' | 'trial'`
- Returns `false` for non-premium users or users without subscription

### 3. Web Application Updates

**Files Modified:**

#### ProfileHeader Component
- `/src/features/users/components/ProfileHeader.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `currentViewer` prop to accept the logged-in user viewing the profile
- Checks premium access using `canSeeVerifiedBadges(currentViewer)`
- Shows verified badge only if:
  - Viewer has premium access, OR
  - Viewer is viewing their own profile
- Shows "Premium Feature" tag with upgrade tooltip for non-premium users

#### PuppyList Component
- `/packages/shared-components/src/PuppyList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Checks premium access for the current viewing user
- Shows verified breeder badge only if user has premium
- Shows "Premium" tag with upgrade tooltip for non-premium users on verified breeder puppies

#### Breeder Directory Pages
- `/src/app/breeders/page.tsx`
- `/src/features/breeders/pages/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `useAuth` hook to get current user
- Checks premium access using `canSeeVerifiedBadges(user)`
- Shows verified badge only for premium users
- Shows "Premium" tag with upgrade tooltip for non-premium users

### 4. Dog Parent App Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `/apps/dog-parent-app/src/app/breeders/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Same implementation as main web app
- Checks premium access before showing verified badges
- Shows premium upgrade prompt for non-premium users

### 5. Mobile App

**No Changes Required:**
- The mobile app only shows verification badges on the user's own profile
- Users should always see their own verification status
- No screens in the mobile app show other users' verification badges

## User Experience

### Premium Users
- See green "Verified" badges on verified dog parents and breeders
- Standard verification checkmark icon
- Clear indication of trusted users

### Non-Premium Users
- See gold "Premium" tag instead of verified badge
- Tooltip message: "Upgrade to Premium to see verified breeders/users"
- Cannot see who is verified vs not verified
- Encourages premium subscription for trust & safety features

### Own Profile
- Users always see their own verification status
- No premium required to see your own verification
- Maintains transparency about account status

## Technical Implementation

### Premium Check Logic
```typescript
const hasPremiumAccess = canSeeVerifiedBadges(user);

// Returns true if:
// - user.isPremium === true
// - user.subscriptionStatus === 'active' OR 'trial'
```

### Badge Display Logic
```typescript
// Show verified badge if premium OR own profile
{user.verified && (hasPremiumAccess || isOwnProfile) && (
  <CheckCircleOutlined />
)}

// Show premium upsell if not premium
{user.verified && !hasPremiumAccess && !isOwnProfile && (
  <Tag icon={<CrownOutlined />} color="gold">
    Premium
  </Tag>
)}
```
