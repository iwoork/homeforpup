## 🚀 Deployment Commands (Copy & Paste)

### Step 1: Create Profiles Table (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup
node scripts/setup-profiles-table.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Table 'homeforpup-profiles' created successfully!
✅ Table is now ACTIVE and ready to use!
```

### Step 2: Migrate Data - OPTIONAL (5 minutes)

**Only run if you have existing users in `homeforpup-users` table:**

```bash
node scripts/migrate-users-to-profiles.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📊 Migration Summary:
   ✅ Migrated: X users
   ⏭️  Skipped: 0
   ❌ Errors: 0
```

**Skip this step if:**
- Fresh installation with no existing users
- Users table doesn't exist yet
- Starting fresh

### Step 3: Deploy API (10 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/homeforpup-api
npm run build
npx cdk deploy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Deployment complete!
✅ All Lambda functions deployed
✅ API Gateway updated
```

**What gets deployed:**
- New `/profiles` endpoints
- Updated `/dogs` endpoints (with kennel join)
- Updated authorization logic
- All Lambda functions

### Step 4: Test Endpoints (5 minutes)

```bash
# Get your API URL from the deployment output
API_URL="https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/development"

# Test 1: Profile endpoint (should work now!)
curl $API_URL/profiles/YOUR-USER-ID

# Expected: { "profile": { "userId": "...", "email": "...", ... } }

# Test 2: Dog with kennel join
curl $API_URL/dogs/YOUR-DOG-ID

# Expected: { "dog": {...}, "kennel": {...} }

# Test 3: Dogs list
curl "$API_URL/dogs?limit=5"

# Expected: { "dogs": [{...kennel...}, ...], "pagination": {...} }
```

### Step 5: Test Mobile App (10 minutes)

1. **Open mobile app**
2. **Login** - Should work without 403 errors ✅
3. **View profile** - Should load correctly ✅
4. **Create dog** - Should show kennel selector ✅
5. **Edit dog** - Should show kennel selector ✅
6. **View dog details** - Should show kennel info ✅

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

### API Endpoints
- [ ] ✅ GET /profiles/:id returns profile (no 403 error!)
- [ ] ✅ PUT /profiles/:id updates profile
- [ ] ✅ GET /dogs/:id includes kennel object
- [ ] ✅ GET /dogs includes kennels for all dogs
- [ ] ✅ POST /dogs validates kennel access
- [ ] ✅ PUT /dogs/:id validates kennel permission

### Mobile App
- [ ] ✅ Login works without 403 errors
- [ ] ✅ Profile loads correctly
- [ ] ✅ Create dog form shows kennel selector
- [ ] ✅ Edit dog form shows kennel selector
- [ ] ✅ Single kennel shows as disabled with lock
- [ ] ✅ Multiple kennels show in modal picker
- [ ] ✅ Dog details show kennel information

### Authorization
- [ ] ✅ Can edit dog if kennel owner
- [ ] ✅ Can edit dog if kennel manager
- [ ] ✅ Cannot edit dog without access (403)
- [ ] ✅ Can only update own profile

### Performance
- [ ] ✅ Profile loads in < 200ms
- [ ] ✅ Dog detail loads in < 200ms (includes kennel)
- [ ] ✅ Dog list loads in < 300ms (includes kennels)
- [ ] ✅ No performance degradation

## 📊 What to Monitor

### CloudWatch Logs (First 24 Hours)

```bash
# Profile endpoints
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/get-profile --follow
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/update-profile --follow

# Dog endpoints
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/get-dog --follow
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/list-dogs --follow
```

**Watch for:**
- ❌ Any 403 errors (should be none after auth fix)
- ❌ Any 500 errors
- ✅ Successful 200 responses
- ✅ Kennel data in dog responses
- ✅ Profile data without Cognito fields

### DynamoDB Metrics

```bash
# Check profiles table activity
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name homeforpup-profiles

# Should see:
# - ReadCapacity being used
# - WriteCapacity minimal
# - ItemCount increasing with new users
```

### Mobile App Logs

**Watch for:**
- ✅ "Token extracted: { isJWT: true }" logs
- ✅ Successful API responses
- ❌ No 403 authorization errors
- ✅ Kennel data loading in dog screens

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If you encounter issues, instant rollback:

```bash
# 1. Edit config to point back to old table
# File: apps/homeforpup-api/lib/config/environments.ts
# Change: profiles: 'homeforpup-users'  // Point back temporarily

# 2. Redeploy
cd apps/homeforpup-api
npx cdk deploy

# 3. Investigate issues
# Old table still has all data

# 4. Fix issues and redeploy to profiles
# Change back: profiles: 'homeforpup-profiles'
# npx cdk deploy
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

## 📞 Support

### If You See Errors

**403 Authorization Error:**
- ✅ Should be fixed with token extraction update
