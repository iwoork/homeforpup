# Privacy & Notifications Settings Refactor

## Overview
Refactored privacy settings and notifications preferences into separate, dedicated screens accessible from the Profile menu, removing them from the EditProfileScreen for better organization and user experience.

## Changes Made

- Three notification channels:
  - Email Notifications
  - SMS Notifications
  - Push Notifications
- Info card explaining what notifications users will receive
- Real-time sync with API
- Save and Cancel buttons
- Back navigation
- Loading states

**User Experience:**
- Clean, focused interface
- Icons for each notification type
- Descriptive text for each option
- Separate Save/Cancel actions
- Returns to Profile screen after saving

#### PrivacySettingsScreen (`/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Dedicated screen for privacy settings
- Three visibility controls:
  - Show Email Address
  - Show Phone Number  
  - Show Location
- Security info card with features:
  - Encrypted Communications
  - Verified Accounts
  - No Data Selling
- Real-time sync with API

**User Experience:**

### 2. Updated EditProfileScreen

#### Removed Sections:
- ❌ Privacy Settings section (lines 590-611)
- ❌ Notification Settings section (lines 613-634)
- ❌ `preferences` state variable
- ❌ `renderSwitch` function
- ❌ `Switch` component import
- ❌ Switch-related styles (switchGroup, switchHeader, switchLabel, switchDescription)

#### Removed from Form Submission:
- ❌ Privacy preferences (showEmail, showPhone, showLocation)
- ❌ Notification preferences (emailNotifications, smsNotifications, pushNotifications)

#### What Remains:
- ✅ Personal Information (name, firstName, lastName, displayName, phone, location, bio)
- ✅ Email field (readonly/non-editable)
- ✅ Business Information section (breeders only) - directs to Manage Kennels
- ✅ Social Media (dog parents only)
- ✅ Photo upload

**Result:**
- Simpler, more focused profile editing experience
- ~60 lines of code removed
- No longer managing multiple concerns in one screen

### 3. Updated ProfileScreen Navigation

**File:** `/apps/mobile-app/src/screens/main/ProfileScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 315: Updated Notifications menu item to navigate to `NotificationsScreen`
- Line 322: Updated Privacy & Security menu item to navigate to `PrivacySettingsScreen`

**Before:**
```typescript
onPress: () => {}, // TODO: Navigate to notifications
onPress: () => {}, // TODO: Navigate to privacy settings
```

**After:**
```typescript
onPress: () => navigation.navigate('NotificationsScreen' as never),
onPress: () => navigation.navigate('PrivacySettingsScreen' as never),
```

## Architecture

### Information Organization

**EditProfileScreen** (Personal Info):

### User Flow

1. **Profile Screen** → Tap "Edit Profile" → Edit personal information
2. **Profile Screen** → Tap "Notifications" → Manage notification preferences

- [ ] Toggle each privacy setting
- [ ] Tap Save → Should update and navigate back
- [ ] Tap Cancel → Should navigate back without saving
- [ ] Check loading state on mount

**Solution:** Created two dedicated screens (NotificationsScreen and PrivacySettingsScreen) accessible from the Profile menu, removing complexity from EditProfileScreen.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code
- ✅ Easier to find and change settings
- ✅ Scalable architecture for future features
- ✅ ~60 lines of code removed from EditProfileScreen
