# Mobile App Profile Refactor - Complete Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the profile-related changes made to the mobile app to improve organization, reduce redundancy, and enhance user experience.

---

## All Changes Made

### 1. Removed Breeder Information Section ✅
**Issue:** Redundant fields between user profile and kennel management

**Solution:**
- Removed website, license, experience, specialties fields from EditProfileScreen
- Replaced with "Business Information" section containing:
  - Info card explaining business info is in kennels
  - Prominent "Manage Kennels" button (blue, full-width)
- Social media fields removed for breeders (managed in kennels)

**Files:** `EditProfileScreen.tsx` (lines 477-498)

---

### 2. Made Email Field Read-Only ✅
**Issue:** Users shouldn't be able to change email (authentication identifier)

**Solution:**
- Added `editable` option to `renderInput` function
- Email field set to `editable: false`
- Visual styling for disabled state:
  - Grayed background
  - Lighter text color
  - Dimmed icon
  - Cannot be tapped

**Files:** `EditProfileScreen.tsx` (lines 376-426, 504-508, 779-785)

---

### 3. Created Dedicated Screens ✅

#### NotificationsScreen
**Purpose:** Manage notification preferences separately

**Features:**
- Email notifications toggle
- SMS notifications toggle
- Push notifications toggle
- Info card explaining what notifications users receive
- Contextual content (different for breeders vs dog parents)
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Loading states
- API integration

**Files:** `src/screens/main/NotificationsScreen.tsx` (275 lines)

#### PrivacySettingsScreen
**Purpose:** Manage privacy settings separately

**Features:**

- Security info card with:
  - Encrypted communications
  - Verified accounts
  - No data selling
- Note about visibility to interacted users
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Loading states

**Files:** `src/screens/main/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx` (325 lines)

### 4. Fixed Profile Data Loading ✅
**Issue:** Profile information not loading, showing empty fields

**Solutions:**
- Added useEffect to update form when user context changes
- Enhanced loading state check (shows spinner until user loads)
- Added detailed debug logging
- Form now populates even if user loads after mount

**Files:** `EditProfileScreen.tsx` (lines 46-67, 69-93, 388-397)

---

### 5. Updated Navigation ✅

#### ProfileScreen Menu Items
Updated two menu items to navigate to new screens:
- "Notifications" → `NotificationsScreen`
- "Privacy & Security" → `PrivacySettingsScreen`

**Files:** `ProfileScreen.tsx` (lines 315, 322)

#### AppNavigator Routes
Registered two new screens in navigation stack:
- `NotificationsScreen` (headerShown: false)
- `PrivacySettingsScreen` (headerShown: false)

**Files:** `AppNavigator.tsx` (lines 25-26, 434-443)

## Migration Guide

### For Users:
**No migration needed!** All existing preferences are automatically loaded from the database.

1. Privacy settings moved to: **Profile → Privacy & Security**
2. Notification settings moved to: **Profile → Notifications**
3. Personal information still in: **Profile → Edit Profile**
4. Business information still in: **Manage Kennels** (breeders)

### For Developers:

**Navigation Routes Added:**
```typescript
// In AppNavigator.tsx
import NotificationsScreen from '../screens/main/NotificationsScreen';
import PrivacySettingsScreen from '../screens/main/PrivacySettingsScreen';

<Stack.Screen name="NotificationsScreen" component={NotificationsScreen} />
<Stack.Screen name="PrivacySettingsScreen" component={PrivacySettingsScreen} />
```

**EditProfileScreen Simplified:**
- No longer manages preferences
- Only handles personal information
- Preferences now managed in dedicated screens

---

## API Integration

Both new screens follow the same pattern:

1. **On Mount:**
   - Fetch current preferences from API
   - Show loading spinner
   - Populate form with current values

2. **On Save:**
   - Validate changes
   - Call API to update preferences
   - Update local user context
   - Show success message
   - Navigate back to Profile

3. **On Cancel:**
   - Discard changes
   - Navigate back to Profile

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/users/{userId}` - Fetch user data
- `PUT /api/users/{userId}` - Update user data
