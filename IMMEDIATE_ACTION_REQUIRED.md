# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Fix 403 Error

## What's Happening

You're still seeing 403 errors because the mobile app needs to be **rebuilt with the new code**.

## üî¥ DO THIS RIGHT NOW:

### Step 1: Rebuild the Mobile App

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app

# Stop current app (Ctrl+C)

# Clear cache and rebuild
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

Then in a NEW terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app

# iOS:
npx react-native run-ios

# OR Android:
npx react-native run-android
```

### Step 2: Login and Check Logs

After rebuild, login and look for these NEW debug logs:

```
üîç idToken object: {
  type: "...",
  constructor: "...",
  hasToString: true/false,
  keys: [...]
}

getAuthToken: Token extracted: {
  isJWT: true/false,  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
  startsWithEyJ: true/false,  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
  tokenPreview: "..."  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
}

API request with auth: {
  tokenPreview: "...",  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
  isJWT: true/false,  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
  startsWithEyJ: true/false  ‚Üê IMPORTANT
}
```

### Step 3: Share the Debug Output

**Copy and share these specific log values:**
1. `idToken object.type` - What is it?
2. `isJWT` - Is it true or false?
3. `startsWithEyJ` - Is it true or false?
4. `tokenPreview` - What are the first 50 characters?

This will tell us exactly what's wrong.

## Why This is Needed

**The code has been fixed in the source files**, but:
- ‚ùå Your running app is using the OLD cached code
- ‚ùå Metro bundler needs to reload the changes
- ‚ùå The app needs to be rebuilt for changes to take effect

**After rebuild:**
- ‚úÖ New token extraction code will run
- ‚úÖ Debug logging will show us what's happening
- ‚úÖ We can identify the exact issue

## If You Can't Rebuild Right Now

### Alternative: Tell Me Your Amplify Version

Check your package.json:

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app
grep "aws-amplify" package.json
```

Share the version, and I can adjust the token extraction for that specific version.

## Expected Outcome

After rebuild with the new debug code, we'll see:

**If JWT is correct:**
```
isJWT: true
startsWithEyJ: true
tokenPreview: "eyJraWQiOiJ..."
‚Üí Should work! No 403 error
```

**If JWT is still wrong:**
```
isJWT: false
startsWithEyJ: false  
tokenPreview: "HqgCXNnU0zj..."
‚Üí Debug logs will show us why
‚Üí We'll fix the extraction method
```

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**You MUST rebuild the mobile app for the fixes to work.**

The changes are in the code, but your running app hasn't loaded them yet.

**Just run:**
```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/mobile-app
npx react-native start --reset-cache
# Then run-ios or run-android in new terminal
```

**Then login and check the new debug logs!**

The debug logging will show us exactly what's happening with the token extraction.
