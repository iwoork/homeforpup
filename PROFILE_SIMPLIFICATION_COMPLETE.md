## Architecture

### Single Source of Truth: Kennel Profiles

All breeder business information is managed through **Kennel Management** in both web and mobile apps:

**Kennel Information Includes:**
- Basic Information (name, description, contact)
- Location (full address)
- Facilities (indoor/outdoor space, amenities)
- Capacity & Specialties (max dogs/litters, breed specialties)
- **Social Media** (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube)
- Business details (website, license, experience)

### Personal vs Business Information

| Information Type | Where to Manage |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Personal** (name, email, phone, bio) | User Profile |
| **Business** (website, license, specialties, social media) | Kennel Profile |
| **Authentication** (sign-in email) | AWS Cognito |

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

**Breeders who had data in profile fields:**
- Data is stored in user record in DynamoDB
- Not deleted, just not shown in mobile edit form
- Can still be accessed via API if needed
- Should create/update kennel profiles with this information

**Dog Parents:**
- No changes to their experience
- Can still update social media in profile

### For Developers

**If you need to show breeder info fields again:**
1. Remove the `user?.userType === 'breeder'` conditions
2. Add back the removed fields to formData initialization
3. Restore the breeder info handling in form submission
4. But consider: Is this information better managed in kennels?

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Data Migration Script:** Copy existing breeder info from user profiles to their first kennel
2. **Kennel Social Media UI:** Enhance mobile kennel edit to include social media fields
3. **Profile Completeness Indicator:** Show breeders if they need to create a kennel
4. **Onboarding Flow:** Guide new breeders to create their first kennel
5. **API Consolidation:** Consider if user breederInfo fields should be deprecated
