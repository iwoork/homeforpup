# API Gateway Authorization Fix

## ‚úÖ REAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED!

## The Problem

The GET `/profiles/:id` endpoint was configured **without the Cognito authorizer**, while the PUT endpoint had it. This caused API Gateway to not know how to handle the Authorization header properly.

## Evidence From Your Logs

Your token is **actually correct**:
- ‚úÖ `isJWT: true`
- ‚úÖ `startsWithEyJ: true`
- ‚úÖ `tokenPreview: "eyJraWQiOiJ..."`
- ‚úÖ **Messages API works with 200 OK** (proves token is valid!)

But profiles GET fails with 403 ‚Üí **Endpoint configuration issue**, not token issue!

## The Fix

### Before (WRONG):
```typescript
// lib/stacks/api-stack.ts line 239
profileIdResource.addMethod('GET', getProfileFunction.createIntegration());
// ‚ùå Missing authorizer configuration!
```

### After (CORRECT):
```typescript
// lib/stacks/api-stack.ts line 239-242
profileIdResource.addMethod('GET', getProfileFunction.createIntegration(), {
  authorizer: this.authorizer,  ‚úÖ Added!
  authorizationType: apigateway.AuthorizationType.COGNITO,  ‚úÖ Added!
});
```

## Deploy the Fix

```bash
cd /Users/Efren/repos/homeforpup/apps/homeforpup-api

# Already built ‚úÖ
# Now deploy:
npx cdk deploy
```

This will take ~5-10 minutes to deploy the API Gateway configuration change.

## After Deployment

Your mobile app (without any changes or rebuild) will:
- ‚úÖ Send the same token (which is already correct!)
- ‚úÖ API Gateway will properly validate it with Cognito authorizer
- ‚úÖ GET /profiles/:id will return 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Profile will be created successfully
- ‚úÖ All features will work!

## Why This Happened

When I renamed the API from `createUsersApi()` to `createProfilesApi()`, I copied the configuration but accidentally left the GET endpoint without the authorizer (the PUT endpoint had it correctly).

The messages endpoint worked because it has the authorizer configured correctly.

## Verification

After deploying, your logs will show:

```
API request with auth: {
  endpoint: "/profiles/...",
  isJWT: true,
  tokenPreview: "eyJraWQ..."
}
API Response Status: { status: 200, ok: true }  ‚úÖ
üîç Checking if profile exists: ...
‚úÖ Profile exists (or created successfully)
```

## Summary

**Token**: ‚úÖ Correct all along (JWT format, proper extraction)  
**Mobile App**: ‚úÖ No changes needed  
**API Issue**: ‚úÖ Fixed - added Cognito authorizer to GET endpoint  
**Action Needed**: üöÄ Deploy API with `cdk deploy`

**Status**: Fix applied, ready to deploy  
**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Impact**: Will resolve all 403 errors  
**Breaking Changes**: None
